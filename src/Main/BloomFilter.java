/**
 * Implementation of a Bloom-filter, as described here:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter
 *
 * For updates and bugfixes, see http://github.com/magnuss/java-bloomfilter
 *
 * Inspired by the SimpleBloomFilter-class written by Ian Clarke. This
 * implementation provides a more evenly distributed Hash-function by
 * using a proper digest instead of the Java RNG. Many of the changes
 * were proposed in comments in his blog:
 * http://blog.locut.us/2008/01/12/a-decent-stand-alone-java-bloom-filter-implementation/

 * @param <E> Object type that is to be inserted into the Bloom filter, e.g. String or Integer.
